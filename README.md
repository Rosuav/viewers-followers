Twitch Viewers and Followers
============================

Hypothesis:

1. "Big channels" have more followers and more viewers than do "small channels", and gain viewers at a greater rate.
2. However, these rates differ for different categories - eg Creative vs Gaming vs IRL.
3. With a baseline established, statistical outliers can be recognized and explored.
